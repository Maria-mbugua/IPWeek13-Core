# UNSUPERVISED LEARNING

# a) Specifying the Question

Performing clustering stating insights drawn from your analysis and visualizations.

# b) Defining the Metrics of Success

Performing Bivariates and univariate Exploratory data analysis and Performing clustering stating insights drawn from the analysis and visualizations. Upon implementation, provide comparisons between the approaches of K-Means clustering vs Hierarchical clustering highlighting the strengths and limitations of each approach in the context of your analysis.

# c) Understanding the context

Kira Plastinina is a Russian brand that is sold through a defunct chain of retail stores in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, China, Philippines, and Armenia. The brand’s Sales and Marketing team would like to understand their customer’s behavior from data that they have collected over the past year. More specifically, they would like to learn the characteristics of customer groups.

# d) Recording the Experimental Design

1. Define the question, the metric for success, the context, experimental design taken.

2. Reading and exploring the dataset.
 
3. Finding  and dealing with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.
 
4. Perform univariate and bivariate analysis.

5. Perform clustering stating insights drawn from the analysis and visualizations.

# e) Relevance of the data

The data used for this project is necessary for understanding their customer’s behavior from data that they have collected over the past year.
